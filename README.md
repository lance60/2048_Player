# 2048_Player

This program plays a game called 2048 using expectimax algorithm
with following heuristics:
- Score: How much the game score increased
- Number of empty tiles: How many empty tiles are remaining
- Monotonicity: How monotonic the board is. That is, how are the tiles
arranged in descending order starting from the corner of the board.
- Smoothness: How close a tile's value is to each of its neighboring tile's value.

The javascript file consists of an implementation of the game and the decision making process.
There is also webpage demonstration included in the repository.

To do:
- Optimization (alpha-beta pruning).
- Reduce repeated code.
